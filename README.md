# SQL - RSVP-Movies-Case-Study

## Problem Introduction
RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released 
movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience 
in 2022.

 

The production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on data and have approached you for help with 
this new project. You have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past three years. 
You have to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project. 

 

You are a data analyst and an SQL expert. You have to use SQL to analyse the given data and give recommendations to RSVP 
Movies based on the insights.

## Data Set and Database Creation
1. Download the IMDb dataset.
2. The first tab contains the ERD and the table details. Study that carefully and understand the relationships between 
the table.
3. Inspect each table given in the subsequent tabs and understand the features associated with each of them.
4. Open your MySQL Workbench or SQL manager of your choice and start writing the DDL and DML commands to create the 
database.

If you don't wish to perform the data loading part, you can directly download the SQL script file containing all the 
commands and data required for the database creation and start directly with the querying.
